# nilm_final_project

Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a method in which a meter gathers samples of the total grid and tries to detect what devices or appliances are on the grid, while seperating the consuption that each of them takes. 

This repository consists of a server that runs a solution to the NILM problem and an android app that interacts with the user.
