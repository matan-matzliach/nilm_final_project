  2) run mdb_to_csv_macro.exe (save as table2.csv in satecsamples/1/ or run step 3 as a python code and change the path to your csv location)
  3) run low_parser_server.py
  4) go to CMD (in windows computers) or to terminal (in mac or linux) and run the command ipconfig (in windows computers) or ifconfig (in mac or linux) and retrieve the ipv4 address of your computer (or easier just see the ip address that step 3 has returned).
